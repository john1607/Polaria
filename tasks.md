## 6. Testing Steps (Repeatable After Each Task)

For each testable task above, validate with:

- [ ] **Data Check Test:** Confirm output in `chrome.storage.local` or Firestore.
- [ ] **UI Feedback Test:** Ensure user receives correct visual cue.
- [ ] **Network Activity Test:** Observe success/failure in dev tools console.

## Notes

- Use Firebase Emulator for offline + local dev during early testing.
- Store logs for each step to support rollback and regression testing.
- Allow content saving and viewing to work offline (sync later if unauthenticated).
